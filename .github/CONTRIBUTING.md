## Contributing Agents

Agents live in `chati.dev/agents/{category}/`. Each agent is a Markdown file with a strict structure.

### Required Structure

```markdown
# {Name} Agent — {Subtitle}

## Identity
- **Role**: ...
- **Pipeline Position**: After {previous}, Before {next}
- **Category**: DISCOVER | PLAN | Quality | BUILD | DEPLOY

## Mission
One paragraph describing what this agent does and why.

## On Activation
1. Read handoff from previous agent
2. Read session context
3. ...

## Execution: N Steps
### Step 1: ...
### Step 2: ...

## Self-Validation (Protocol 5.1)
Define binary pass/fail criteria specific to THIS agent.

## Output
What artifacts this agent produces and where they go.

## Input
$ARGUMENTS
```

### Agent Checklist

- [ ] Follows all 8 Universal Protocols (5.1-5.8)
- [ ] Self-validation criteria are binary (pass/fail), not subjective
- [ ] Handoff format matches the Two-Layer Protocol (Article VIII)
- [ ] Uses `$ARGUMENTS` as input placeholder
- [ ] Language Protocol: interaction in user lang, artifacts in English
- [ ] Includes `*help` power user table
- [ ] Updated in entity registry (`chati.dev/data/entity-registry.yaml`)

---

## Contributing to the Intelligence Layer

The Intelligence Layer has three systems. See the individual spec files below.

### Context Engine (`chati.dev/intelligence/context-engine.md`)

- 4 brackets: FRESH, MODERATE, DEPLETED, CRITICAL
- 5 injection layers: L0 (Constitution) through L4 (Task)
- Changes must respect Article XII (Context Bracket Governance)

### Memory Layer (`chati.dev/intelligence/memory-layer.md`)

- 4 cognitive sectors: Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Reflective
- 3 retrieval levels: Metadata, Chunks, Full
- Changes must respect Article XIII (Memory Governance)

### Decision Engine (`chati.dev/intelligence/decision-engine.md`)

- REUSE/ADAPT/CREATE decision framework
- Jaccard similarity + purpose matching
- Changes must respect Article XIV (Framework Registry Governance)

---

## Contributing Templates & Workflows

### Templates (`chati.dev/templates/`)

Templates are YAML files that define artifact structure. They are filled in by agents during execution.

```yaml
# Example: task-tmpl.yaml
metadata:
  name: Task Template
  version: "1.0"
  used_by: tasks-agent
sections:
  - id: ...
    title: ...
    content: ...
```

### Workflows (`chati.dev/workflows/`)

Workflows define agent sequences for different project types.

```yaml
# Example: greenfield-fullstack.yaml
metadata:
  name: Greenfield Fullstack
  type: greenfield
pipeline:
  - agent: greenfield-wu
  - agent: brief
  - agent: detail
  # ...
```

## Contributing Translations (i18n)

Translation files live in `chati.dev/i18n/`. Each language has a YAML file with all user-facing strings.

### Adding a New Language

1. Copy `chati.dev/i18n/en.yaml` to `chati.dev/i18n/{code}.yaml`
2. Translate all string values (keys remain in English)
3. Add the language code to `chati.dev/schemas/session.schema.json` in the `language` enum
4. Add CLI translations in `packages/chati-dev/src/wizard/i18n.js`
5. Update the README language table

### Translation Rules

- Keys are always in English
- Values follow the target language's grammar and conventions
- Technical terms (agent names, pipeline names) stay in English
- Error messages should be constructive: what failed + how to fix

---

## Contributing to the CLI

The CLI package lives in `packages/chati-dev/`. It's a pure ESM Node.js package.

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bin/chati.js` | Entry point, command routing |
| `src/wizard/` | Installation wizard (questions, i18n, feedback) |
| `src/installer/` | Core installer logic, templates, validator |
| `src/dashboard/` | TUI dashboard (data reader, layout, renderer) |
| `src/upgrade/` | Upgrade system (checker, backup, migrator) |
| `src/config/` | IDE and MCP configurations |
| `src/terminal/` | Multi-terminal spawner, monitor, collector, prompt builder, handoff parser |
| `src/context/` | PRISM context engine (5-layer injection pipeline) |
| `src/tasks/` | Handoff management (build, save, load, format) |
| `src/utils/` | Colors, logger, detector |

### Guidelines

- ESM modules only (`import`/`export`)
- No TypeScript — plain JavaScript for simplicity
- Use `join()` from `path` — never hardcode paths
- Error handling with try/catch at system boundaries
- No external HTTP calls in core logic

---

## Code Standards

### Markdown (Agents, Templates, Docs)

- ATX headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Tables properly aligned
- No trailing whitespace
- Max line length: 120 characters (soft limit)

### JavaScript (CLI Package)

- ESM modules (`import`/`export`)
- `const` by default, `let` when needed, never `var`
- Descriptive function names
- JSDoc comments for exported functions
- Error messages: `"Failed to {action}: {reason}"`

### YAML (Templates, Workflows, i18n)

- 2-space indentation
- Quoted strings for values with special characters
- Comments for non-obvious fields

---
