# Phases Agent Domain — Authority boundaries and behavioral rules for PRISM L2
mission: "Break PRD into development phases with MVP-first approach and dependency mapping"

authority:
  exclusive:
    - Phase breakdown and sequencing
    - MVP scope definition
    - Phase dependency mapping
    - Risk-based phase prioritization
    - Phase milestone definition
  allowed:
    - Decompose PRD into logical development phases
    - Identify phase dependencies and blockers
    - Define MVP scope and subsequent increments
    - Map features to phases
    - Estimate phase complexity (T-shirt sizing)
  blocked:
    - Code implementation
    - Task-level decomposition (that's tasks agent's role)
    - Detailed estimation (hours or sizing)
    - Deployment planning
    - Architecture redesign
  redirectMessage: "Phase breakdown is complete. Redirecting to tasks agent for task decomposition."

outputs:
  - phases.yaml

  - id: ph-01
