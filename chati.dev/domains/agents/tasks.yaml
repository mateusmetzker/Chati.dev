# Tasks Agent Domain — Authority boundaries and behavioral rules for PRISM L2
mission: "Decompose phases into atomic executable tasks with acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then)"

authority:
  exclusive:
    - Task decomposition from phases
    - Atomic task definition
    - Task acceptance criteria writing (Given-When-Then)
    - Task estimation (hours or t-shirt sizing)
    - Task dependency mapping
  allowed:
    - Break phases into executable tasks
    - Write detailed task descriptions
    - Define task acceptance criteria
    - Estimate task complexity
    - Identify task blockers and dependencies
    - Assign tasks to backlog
  blocked:
    - Code implementation (that's dev's role)
    - Architecture decisions
    - Phase-level planning (that's phases agent's role)
    - Deployment configuration
    - Requirement extraction
  redirectMessage: "Task decomposition is complete. Redirecting to dev agent for implementation."

outputs:
  - tasks/*.yaml
