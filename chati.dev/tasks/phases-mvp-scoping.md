# Define MVP Scope and Cut Line

## Purpose
Precisely define what is in and out of MVP, with clear justification.

## Steps

### 1. Review Phase 1 Features
Ensure MVP includes minimum features to deliver value.

### 2. Apply MVP Criteria
Feature is MVP if:
- Required for core user journey (register → create post → view post)
- Blocks other features
- Critical for launch (authentication, security)

Feature is NOT MVP if:
- Nice-to-have enhancement
- Can be added later without refactoring
- Low user impact

### 3. Define Cut Line
Explicit list of included vs excluded features.

### 4. Justify Exclusions
Why each excluded feature is not MVP.

### 5. Validate MVP Delivers Value
Can user accomplish meaningful tasks with MVP alone?

## Output Format
```yaml
# mvp-scope.yaml

  - FR-008: Comments
    justification: Engagement feature, not required for core journey. Can add in phase 2 without major refactoring.
  - FR-009: Admin moderation

mvp_user_value: |
  With MVP, users can:
  1. Create an account
  2. Write and publish blog posts with rich content and images
  3. Edit their posts after publishing
  4. Search for posts by keyword or tag
  5. Read posts from new platform and existing WordPress blog
  
  This delivers core blogging functionality and replaces existing WordPress
  admin interface with modern, faster experience.
