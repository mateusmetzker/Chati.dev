# Extract and Detail Non-Functional Requirements

## Purpose
Expand high-level NFRs from brief into detailed, measurable technical specifications.

## Prerequisites
- `brief.yaml` with initial NFRs
- `prd-draft.yaml` for context

## Steps

### 1. Analyze Brief NFRs
Load and categorize existing NFRs into standard categories.

### 2. Define Performance NFRs
- **Response Time**: API endpoints <200ms p50, <500ms p95
- **Page Load**: Initial load <2s, subsequent <1s
- **Time to Interactive**: <3s on 3G network
- **Database Queries**: <100ms for simple queries, <500ms for complex
- **Search**: Results in <1s for 100k posts
- **Concurrent Users**: 10k concurrent without degradation

### 3. Define Security NFRs
- **Authentication**: JWT with 7-day expiration, refresh token support
- **Password Storage**: Bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **HTTPS**: All traffic encrypted (TLS 1.3)
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy headers
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries only
- **CSRF**: Token-based protection
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 req/min per IP, 1000 req/min per user
- **GDPR**: Data export, deletion, consent management

### 4. Define Scalability NFRs
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless API for easy scaling
- **Database**: Connection pooling, read replicas (future)
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: Static assets served from CDN
- **Data Growth**: Support 1M posts, 100k users

### 5. Define Usability NFRs
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile**: Responsive design, works on screens ≥320px
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)
- **Internationalization**: UI prepared for i18n (future)
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable, user-friendly

### 6. Define Reliability NFRs
- **Uptime**: 99.5% (43 hours downtime/year)
- **Backup**: Daily automated backups, 30-day retention
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation, retry logic
- **Data Integrity**: Transactions for critical operations
- **Monitoring**: Uptime checks every minute

### 7. Define Maintainability NFRs
- **Code Coverage**: >80% test coverage
- **Documentation**: API docs, README, architecture docs
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Observability**: Metrics, traces, logs

### 8. Add Measurable Metrics
For each NFR, define:
- Metric name (response_time_p95)
- Target value (500ms)
- Measurement method (APM tool)
- Acceptance criteria (pass/fail threshold)

### 9. Outline Implementation Approaches
For each NFR category, suggest technical approaches.

### 10. Generate NFR Document
Comprehensive, measurable NFR specifications.

## Decision Points
None - autonomous based on best practices.

## Error Handling
- **Conflicting NFRs**: Note conflict and recommend resolution
