# Assess and Recommend Tech Stack

## Purpose
Evaluate project requirements and recommend a complete technology stack across all layers of the application architecture.

## Prerequisites
- `wu-analysis.yaml` with runtime detection
- `scaffold-report.yaml` with scaffolding recommendations
- User requirements or brain dump available

## Steps

### 1. Extract Requirements Context
- Load existing requirement information if available
- Identify key constraints:
  - Performance requirements (latency, throughput)
  - Scale expectations (users, data volume)
  - Team expertise (what they already know)
  - Budget constraints (hosting costs, licensing)
  - Time constraints (MVP timeline)
  - Compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

### 2. Define Application Layers
Identify which layers are needed:
- **Frontend**: Web UI, mobile app, desktop app
- **Backend**: API server, business logic, authentication
- **Database**: Primary data store, cache, search engine
- **File Storage**: Object storage, CDN
- **Message Queue**: Async processing, event streaming
- **Infrastructure**: Hosting, containers, orchestration, CI/CD
- **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting

### 3. Evaluate Frontend Stack
If frontend is required, recommend:
- **Framework**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid
  - Consider: team expertise, ecosystem size, performance needs, TypeScript support
- **UI Library**: Material-UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
  - Consider: design system needs, customization level, bundle size
- **State Management**: Redux, Zustand, Jotai, TanStack Query, Context API
  - Consider: complexity, server state vs. client state
- **Routing**: React Router, Next.js routing, TanStack Router
- **Build Tool**: Vite, webpack, Turbopack, esbuild
- **Testing**: Vitest, Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, Cypress

### 4. Evaluate Backend Stack
If backend is required, recommend:
- **Language/Runtime**: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java
  - Consider: team expertise, performance needs, ecosystem, concurrency model
- **Framework**: Express, Fastify, NestJS (Node); FastAPI, Django (Python); Gin (Go)
  - Consider: structure needs, built-in features, community
- **API Style**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, tRPC
  - Consider: client flexibility needs, type safety, performance
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2, Passport, Auth0, Clerk, NextAuth
- **Validation**: Zod, Yup, Joi, Pydantic
- **ORM/Query Builder**: Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy, GORM

### 5. Evaluate Database Stack
Recommend database(s) based on data patterns:
- **Relational (ACID, structured data)**:
  - PostgreSQL (recommended for most cases)
  - MySQL/MariaDB
  - SQLite (development, edge deployments)
- **Document (flexible schema)**:
  - MongoDB
  - CouchDB
- **Key-Value (cache, sessions)**:
  - Redis (recommended)
  - Memcached
- **Search Engine**:
  - Elasticsearch
  - Meilisearch (simpler alternative)
  - Typesense
- **Time-Series**:
  - TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension)
  - InfluxDB
- **Graph**:
  - Neo4j
  - Amazon Neptune

### 6. Evaluate Infrastructure Stack
Recommend hosting and deployment:
- **Hosting Platform**:
  - Vercel (frontend, serverless)
  - Netlify (frontend, edge functions)
  - Railway (fullstack, simple)
  - Fly.io (global deployment)
  - AWS/GCP/Azure (enterprise scale)
  - DigitalOcean (balance of simplicity and control)
- **Containerization**:
  - Docker (development consistency)
  - Docker Compose (local multi-service)
- **Orchestration** (if scale requires):
  - Kubernetes
  - AWS ECS/Fargate
- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions (recommended)
  - GitLab CI
  - CircleCI
- **CDN**:
  - Cloudflare (recommended for most)
  - AWS CloudFront

### 7. Verify Compatibility Matrix
Check for known compatibility issues:
- Runtime version support (e.g., Node 22 + specific packages)
- Framework version conflicts
- Database driver versions
- TypeScript version alignment across tools
- Build tool compatibility with libraries

### 8. Calculate Total Cost of Ownership
Estimate costs across:
- **Development Time**: Learning curve, productivity
- **Hosting Costs**: Free tier, startup tier ($0-100/mo), scale tier ($100-1000/mo)
- **Maintenance Burden**: Update frequency, breaking changes, security patches
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration difficulty if switching later

### 9. Justify Each Choice
For each major technology decision, provide:
- **Why This**: Specific reasons for choosing this technology
- **Why Not Alternatives**: What alternatives were considered and why rejected
- **Risks**: Known issues, limitations, or concerns
- **Mitigation**: How to address the risks

### 10. Create Migration Path
If user has existing stack, document:
- What can be kept vs. what should change
- Migration strategy (big bang vs. incremental)
- Compatibility bridges needed
- Estimated migration effort

## Decision Points
- **Team Expertise vs. Best Tool**: Ask user to choose between familiar but suboptimal tech vs. learning curve for better tech
- **Build vs. Buy**: For authentication, payments, email, etc., ask if user prefers self-hosted or SaaS
- **Polyglot vs. Monoglot**: If multiple languages would be optimal, ask if team can handle polyglot architecture
- **SQL vs. NoSQL**: If data model is ambiguous, present trade-offs and ask user preference

## Error Handling
- **Conflicting Requirements**: If performance and simplicity conflict (e.g., need for extreme performance but small team), flag the conflict and ask user to prioritize
- **Unsupported Combination**: If user requests incompatible technologies (e.g., specific framework version + specific runtime version), explain incompatibility and offer alternatives
- **Budget Constraints**: If recommended stack exceeds budget, provide tiered alternatives (MVP stack vs. scale stack)
- **Knowledge Gaps**: If team lacks expertise in recommended tech, flag as risk and suggest training resources or alternative choices
