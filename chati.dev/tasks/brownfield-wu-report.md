# Compile Brownfield WU Report

## Purpose
Consolidate all brownfield analysis findings into a comprehensive Work Understanding report with actionable recommendations and migration roadmap.

## Prerequisites
- `discovery.yaml` exists with codebase analysis
- `dependencies.yaml` exists with dependency assessment
- `architecture-map.yaml` exists with architecture documentation
- `risk-assessment.yaml` exists with risk analysis
- `migration-plan.yaml` exists with migration strategy

## Steps

### 1. Load All Analysis Artifacts
- Read all prerequisite YAML files
- Verify completeness and validity
- Extract key findings from each

### 2. Create Executive Summary
Write 5-8 sentence summary covering:
- Project scale and maturity
- Current tech stack
- Critical issues identified (security, performance, debt)
- Overall risk level
- Recommended migration strategy
- Timeline and effort estimates

### 3. Consolidate Codebase Overview
From `discovery.yaml` and `dependencies.yaml`:
- Project statistics (files, LOC, age)
- Tech stack summary
- Framework versions
- Test coverage
- Code quality score

### 4. Summarize Architecture
From `architecture-map.yaml`:
- Architectural pattern
- Key layers and modules
- Design patterns in use
- Identified issues (circular dependencies, god modules, etc.)

### 5. Highlight Critical Issues
From `risk-assessment.yaml`:
- Critical and high-priority risks
- Security vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- Performance bottlenecks
- Technical debt quantification

### 6. Present Migration Roadmap
From `migration-plan.yaml`:
- Chosen strategy with justification
- Phase breakdown with timelines
- Success metrics
- Total effort estimates

### 7. Calculate Overall Health Score
Aggregate health metrics (0-100 scale):
- **Security (25%)**: Vulnerability severity and count
- **Performance (20%)**: Bottlenecks and efficiency
- **Maintainability (25%)**: Code quality, coupling, test coverage
- **Modernity (15%)**: Dependency currency, tech stack age
- **Documentation (15%)**: Documentation completeness and quality
Weighted average = overall health score

### 8. Define Immediate Actions
List top 5-10 actions to take before development:
- Fix critical security issues
- Set up monitoring
- Increase test coverage for critical paths
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Resolve blocking architectural issues

### 9. Provide Recommendations
Categorized by timeframe:
- **Immediate** (this week): Critical fixes
- **Short-term** (this month): High-priority risks
- **Medium-term** (this quarter): Technical debt reduction
- **Long-term** (this year): Complete modernization

### 10. Generate Final Report
Combine all sections into comprehensive YAML with clear structure and actionable content.

## Decision Points
- **Low Health Score (<40)**: Ask user if rewrite should be considered instead of incremental migration
- **High Risk Count (>50)**: Recommend staged approach, addressing highest risks first
- **Long Timeline (>12 months)**: Confirm user commitment and resource availability

## Error Handling
- **Missing Artifacts**: If any prerequisite missing, halt and request completion
- **Conflicting Data**: If artifacts have conflicting information, flag and request clarification
- **Invalid Metrics**: If calculated scores are unrealistic, document assumptions and limitations
