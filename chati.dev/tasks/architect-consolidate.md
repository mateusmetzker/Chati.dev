- Deployment architecture
- ADRs for major decisions

## Output Format

completeness: 100%
[All architecture details consolidated]
architecture_decisions:
  - id: ADR-001
    title: Use Supabase as Backend-as-a-Service
    decision: Use Supabase instead of custom Node.js backend
    rationale: Team lacks backend expertise, Supabase provides auth, database, storage
    status: accepted
  - id: ADR-002
    title: Use TanStack Query for server state
    decision: Use TanStack Query instead of Redux
    rationale: Server state caching, automatic refetching, simpler than Redux
    status: accepted
