# Extract Requirements from User Input

## Purpose
Extract and structure requirements from user's initial brain dump into the five core categories.

## Prerequisites
- User has provided initial project description or brain dump
- Access to user input (text, conversation history, or documents)

## Steps

### 1. Parse User Input
- Read user's brain dump or project description
- Identify key themes and topics
- Note any explicit requirements or constraints
- Flag ambiguities for follow-up questions

### 2. Extract Functional Requirements
Identify **what the system must do**:
- User actions (login, create post, search, etc.)
- System behaviors (send email, process payment, generate report)
- Business rules (user must be 18+, discount applies after 10 purchases)
- Data operations (CRUD operations, calculations, transformations)
- Integrations (third-party APIs, external systems)

Format as: **Actor + Action + Object + Context**
Example: "User can create a blog post with title, content, and tags"

Extract at least 5 functional requirements. If fewer found, ask user for more details.

### 3. Extract Non-Functional Requirements
Identify **how the system should perform**:
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, load time targets
- **Scalability**: Expected users, data volume, growth rate
- **Availability**: Uptime requirements, maintenance windows
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance
- **Usability**: Accessibility, mobile support, user experience quality
- **Compatibility**: Browser support, device support, API versioning
- **Reliability**: Error handling, data backup, disaster recovery
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation, testability

Extract at least 3 NFRs. If none mentioned, use reasonable defaults and note as assumptions.

### 4. Extract Constraints
Identify **limitations and boundaries**:
- **Technical**: Must use specific technology, existing systems to integrate with
- **Budget**: Development cost limits, hosting budget
- **Timeline**: Deadlines, milestones, MVP date
- **Team**: Team size, skills, availability
- **Regulatory**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, industry regulations
- **Business**: Existing contracts, partnerships, brand guidelines
- **Operational**: Support hours, deployment frequency

Extract all explicit constraints. Flag if constraints conflict.

### 5. Identify Personas
Identify **who will use the system**:
- Role name (Admin, Customer, Manager, API Consumer)
- Goals (what they want to achieve)
- Pain points (current problems)
- Technical proficiency (novice, intermediate, expert)
- Frequency of use (daily, weekly, occasional)

Create at least 3 personas. If user hasn't mentioned, infer from functional requirements.

### 6. Define Success Criteria
Identify **how to measure success**:
- Business metrics (revenue, conversion rate, user growth)
- User metrics (engagement, satisfaction, retention)
- Technical metrics (uptime, response time, error rate)
- Project metrics (on-time delivery, budget adherence)

Extract at least 3 success criteria. If none mentioned, ask user to define.

### 7. Identify Gaps and Ambiguities
Flag areas needing clarification:
- Vague requirements ("fast", "user-friendly", "secure")
- Missing details (no authentication method specified)
- Conflicting requirements (need fast delivery but comprehensive features)
- Unclear priorities (everything is "must-have")

Prepare questions to resolve these in next step.

### 8. Structure into YAML
Organize extracted requirements into structured format:
- Group related requirements
- Number each requirement for reference
- Add notes for assumptions or uncertainties
- Mark requirements as explicit (user stated) vs. inferred

### 9. Calculate Extraction Confidence
Assess confidence (0-100) based on:
- Completeness (all categories populated)
- Clarity (requirements are specific vs. vague)
- Consistency (no conflicts)
- Sufficiency (enough detail to proceed)

### 10. Generate Clarification Questions
Create list of questions to ask user:
- Fill gaps (missing categories)
- Resolve ambiguities (vague requirements)
- Prioritize (what's MVP vs. nice-to-have)
- Validate assumptions (inferred requirements)

## Decision Points
- **Minimal Information**: If user provided <100 words, ask for more context before extracting
- **Conflicting Requirements**: Flag immediately and ask for prioritization
- **Regulated Industry**: If healthcare/finance/etc., ask about compliance needs upfront

## Error Handling
- **Empty Input**: Request user to provide project description
- **Non-English Input**: Ask user to provide in English or request translation
- **Multiple Projects**: Ask user to clarify which project to focus on
- **Too Much Information**: Summarize and ask user to confirm understanding

gaps_and_ambiguities:
  - gap: Authentication method not specified (JWT, session, OAuth?)
    severity: medium
    question: What authentication method should we use?
  - gap: Image upload limits not specified
    severity: low
    question: What are max image size and allowed formats?
  - gap: Moderation workflow unclear
    severity: medium
    question: Should moderation be pre-publish or post-publish?
  - gap: Search implementation not detailed

    question: Should search be full-text or simple keyword matching?
  - gap: Priority unclear (all requirements presented as must-have)
    severity: high
    question: Which features are MVP vs. phase 2?

assumptions:
  - Assumed GDPR compliance needed (not explicitly stated but inferred from "EU users" mention)
  - Assumed email confirmation needed for registration (standard practice)
  - Assumed HTTPS for all connections (security best practice)
  - Assumed data encryption at rest (security best practice)

confidence: 78
confidence_reasoning: |
  Good functional requirements coverage (5 FRs). Non-functional requirements
  present but some are vague. Personas identified. Major gap is prioritization
  (MVP vs. future). Authentication details missing. Overall sufficient to proceed
  to validation step where we'll fill gaps.

clarification_questions:
  - Which features are must-have for MVP vs. nice-to-have for later phases?
  - What authentication method do you prefer (JWT, session-based, OAuth)?
  - Should user content moderation be pre-publish (requires approval) or post-publish (published immediately)?
  - What are the image upload constraints (max size, allowed formats)?
  - Do you have an existing user base migrating from WordPress?
  - What analytics are most important to track?

next_steps:
  - Validate completeness of requirements
  - Ask clarification questions
  - Prioritize requirements
  - Map to MVP scope
```
