# Orchestrator Suggest Mode Task

## Purpose
Analyze session state to determine if mode transition conditions are met, calculate confidence, and either suggest to user or autonomously execute the transition.

## Prerequisites
- Session state at `.chati/session.yaml`
- Constitution Article XI at `chati.dev/constitution.md`
- Agent completion data
- Quality scores from QA agents

## Steps

### 1. Load Current Session State
Read session to understand current position:
- Current mode (clarity/build/deploy)
- Last completed agent
- Agent statuses and timestamps
- Quality scores
- Previous mode transitions

### 2. Identify Potential Transitions
Based on current mode, check eligibility for:
- **clarity → build**: Triggered after QA-Planning completes
- **build → validate**: Triggered after Dev completes
- **validate → deploy**: Triggered after QA-Implementation approves

### 3. Evaluate Transition Conditions
For each potential transition, check requirements:

**For clarity → build**:
- QA-Planning agent status = `completed`
- QA-Planning score >= 95%
- All CLARITY agents completed or skipped
- No blocking issues in planning phase

**For build → validate**:
- Dev agent status = `completed`
- All build artifacts present
- No critical build errors

**For validate → deploy**:
- QA-Implementation agent status = `completed`
- QA-Implementation score >= 8.0 (approved)
- No deployment blockers
- All validation criteria met

### 4. Calculate Transition Confidence
Assess readiness on multiple factors:

**Quality Factor** (40% weight):
- Actual score vs. required threshold
- Margin of safety (how far above threshold)

**Completeness Factor** (30% weight):
- All required agents completed
- All required artifacts present
- No pending tasks

**Risk Factor** (20% weight):
- Number of open questions
- Blocker count
- Historical success rate

**Context Factor** (10% weight):
- Recent activity (not stale)
- Session stability
- No recent failures

Combine to get overall confidence: 0-100%

### 5. Check Autonomous Gate Eligibility
Determine if autonomous transition is allowed:
- Article XI specifies autonomous for forward transitions
- Confidence must be >= 90% for auto-execution
- No manual override flags in session
- No recent escalations

### 6. Classify Suggestion Type
Based on confidence and autonomous gate:
- **Auto-Execute** (>= 90% confidence + autonomous enabled)
- **Strong Suggestion** (80-89% confidence)
- **Weak Suggestion** (70-79% confidence)
- **Not Ready** (< 70% confidence)

### 7. Generate Suggestion Context
Build explanation for user:
- Why transition is suggested
- What conditions are met
- What confidence level means
- What happens if user accepts
- What risks exist (if any)

### 8. Execute or Present
Based on classification:

**Auto-Execute**:
- Trigger `orchestrator-mode-switch` immediately
- Log autonomous decision
- Notify user of transition

**Strong/Weak Suggestion**:
- Present to user with confidence level
- List met conditions
- Offer accept/decline
- Wait for user input

**Not Ready**:
- Explain missing conditions
- Show progress toward readiness
- Estimate time to readiness

### 9. Handle User Response
If user input required:
- **Accept**: Trigger `orchestrator-mode-switch`
- **Decline**: Log decision, continue in current mode
- **Defer**: Set reminder to re-evaluate later

### 10. Update Session
Log the suggestion event:
- Timestamp
- Suggestion type
- Confidence score
- User response (if applicable)
- Transition executed (yes/no)

## Decision Points

### When Confidence is Borderline (88-92%)
At the threshold of autonomous execution:
1. Lean toward user confirmation for safety
2. Present strong suggestion instead of auto-execute
3. Highlight the borderline status

### When Multiple Factors Conflict
If quality is high but risks exist:
1. Weight quality more heavily
2. Document risks clearly
3. Suggest with strong warning

### When Session is Stale
If last activity is old (> 7 days):
1. Reduce confidence by 10 points
2. Suggest validation before transition
3. Warn user about staleness

### When Previous Transition Failed
If last mode switch had issues:
1. Reduce confidence by 15 points
2. Require user confirmation even if auto-eligible
3. Reference previous failure in suggestion

## Error Handling

### Quality Score Missing
If QA score is unavailable:
- Assume condition not met
- Suggest running QA agent
- Do not proceed with transition

### Session State Inconsistent
If mode doesn't match agent statuses:
1. Recalculate mode from agent progress
2. Flag inconsistency
3. Suggest health check

### Agent Status Ambiguous
If agent shows `in_progress` but has handoff:
1. Check handoff timestamp vs. agent timestamp
2. Infer completion if handoff is newer
3. Log ambiguity for investigation

### Confidence Calculation Error
If factors yield impossible result (e.g., >100%):
1. Log calculation error
2. Fall back to manual suggestion
3. Do not auto-execute

### User Response Timeout
If user doesn't respond to suggestion:
1. Preserve suggestion in session
2. Re-present on next invocation
3. Don't force decision

### Example: Strong Suggestion (Not Auto-Execute)

```yaml
mode_suggestion:
  confidence_analysis:
    overall_confidence: 87

  suggestion_classification: "strong-suggestion"

  decision:
    action: "suggest-to-user"
    requires_confirmation: true
    rationale: |
      QA-Planning completed with good score (96.5%).
      Confidence 87% is below 90% threshold for autonomous execution.
      3 open questions reduce confidence. Suggesting to user.

  user_prompt: |
    Mode Transition Available: CLARITY → BUILD

    QA-Planning completed with score 96.5% (>= 95% required).
    Confidence: 87% (strong suggestion)

    Considerations:
    ✓ Quality score exceeds threshold
    ✓ All CLARITY agents complete
    ⚠ 3 open questions remain (non-blocking)

    Proceed with transition to BUILD mode? (yes/no)

  execution:
    trigger_mode_switch: false  # Awaiting user input
    mode_switch_task: "orchestrator-mode-switch"
    await_user_response: true
```

### Example: Not Ready

```yaml
mode_suggestion:
  confidence_analysis:
    overall_confidence: 65

  suggestion_classification: "not-ready"

  decision:
    action: "inform-user"
    rationale: |
      QA-Planning completed but score is 92% (below 95% threshold).
      Confidence 65% is too low for transition.
      Recommend addressing planning issues first.

  user_notification: |
    Mode Transition: Not Ready

    QA-Planning score: 92% (95% required for CLARITY → BUILD)

    To proceed:
    1. Address planning issues identified by QA-Planning
    2. Re-run QA-Planning to achieve >= 95% score

    Current confidence: 65% (needs improvement)

  execution:
    trigger_mode_switch: false
