# Orchestrator Mode Switch Task

## Purpose
Execute transitions between modes (clarity, build, deploy) while enforcing Article XI governance rules and validating quality gates.

## Prerequisites
- Session state at `.chati/session.yaml`
- Constitution Article XI at `chati.dev/constitution.md`
- Quality scores from QA agents
- Agent completion statuses

## Steps

### 1. Receive Transition Trigger
Identify the transition request:
- **Autonomous**: Quality gate met, auto-transition enabled
- **Suggested**: Conditions met, awaiting user confirmation
- **Manual**: User explicitly requests mode change
- **Backward**: QA-Implementation found spec issues, reverting to clarity

### 2. Load Current Mode State
Read session to understand current position:
- Current mode (clarity/build/deploy)
- Last completed agent in current mode
- Quality scores
- Mode transition history

### 3. Validate Transition Direction
Check if transition is valid per Article XI:
- **Forward transitions**: clarity → build, build → validate, validate → deploy
- **Backward transitions**: build/validate → clarity (on spec issues)
- **Invalid**: deploy → build, build → clarity (except on QA failure)

### 4. Check Transition Preconditions
Verify mode-specific requirements are met:

**For clarity → build**:
- QA-Planning agent completed
- QA-Planning score >= 95%
- All CLARITY agents complete or skipped
- No blocking issues

**For build → validate**:
- Dev agent completed
- All build outputs present
- No critical errors

**For validate → deploy**:
- QA-Implementation agent completed
- QA-Implementation approved (score >= 8.0)
- No deployment blockers

**For backward to clarity**:
- QA-Implementation found spec/architecture issues
- Issues documented in handoff
- User confirmation obtained (if manual)

### 5. Evaluate Autonomous Gate
Check if transition should be automatic:
- Article XI specifies autonomous transitions for forward moves when gates met
- Backward transitions require user confirmation
- Manual overrides require deviation protocol

### 6. Calculate Confidence Score
Assess readiness for transition:
- Quality scores from QA agents
- Completeness of artifacts
- Number of open questions
- Blocker status
- Return confidence: high (>90%), medium (70-90%), low (<70%)

### 7. Execute or Suggest Transition
Based on autonomous_gate and confidence:
- **Auto-transition**: confidence high + autonomous enabled → execute
- **Suggest**: confidence medium OR manual trigger → ask user
- **Block**: confidence low → escalate with issues

### 8. Update Session Mode
If transition approved:
- Change `mode` field in session.yaml
- Set `current_agent` to first agent of new mode
- Log transition in `mode_transitions` array
- Update `pipeline_position`

### 9. Apply Mode Scope Restrictions
Enforce Article XI scope rules for new mode:
- **clarity**: Read all, write only to `chati.dev/` directory
- **build**: Full filesystem access
- **deploy**: Full access + infrastructure operations

### 10. Dispatch to Next Agent
Route to first agent of new mode:
- **build mode**: Route to `dev` agent
- **deploy mode**: Route to `devops` agent
- **clarity mode** (backward): Route to agent that needs rework

## Decision Points

### When Quality Gate is Borderline
If QA score is 94% (just under 95% threshold):
1. Check if issues are minor vs. critical
2. For minor: Suggest override with warning
3. For critical: Block transition, require rework

### When User Requests Override
If user wants to force transition despite low confidence:
1. Trigger deviation protocol
2. Document override in audit trail
3. Require explicit confirmation
4. Proceed with warning flags

### When Backward Transition is Needed
If QA-Implementation finds fundamental spec problems:
1. Identify which CLARITY agent needs to re-run
2. Mark affected agents as `needs_revalidation`
3. Set mode to `clarity`
4. Route to earliest affected agent

### When Multiple Transitions are Eligible
If conditions for multiple transitions are met (edge case):
1. Follow pipeline sequence (clarity → build → deploy)
2. Execute one transition at a time
3. Re-evaluate after each transition

## Error Handling

### Invalid Transition Request
If transition violates Article XI:
- Block the transition
- Explain the violation
- Show valid transitions from current state

### Quality Gate Data Missing
If QA score is not available:
- Assume gate not met
- Block autonomous transition
- Suggest running QA agent first

### Session Update Failure
If mode can't be written to session:
- Retry with backup creation
- If persistent: Escalate, don't proceed
- Risk of mode desync is high

### Agent Routing Failure
If first agent of new mode can't be loaded:
- Rollback mode change
- Escalate with agent definition error
- Validate framework integrity

### Concurrent Transition Attempt
If another process is changing mode:
- Wait for lock (up to 30 seconds)
- If timeout: Escalate with lock conflict
- Suggest retry
