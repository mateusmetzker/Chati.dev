## [2.0.7] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Ed25519 Manifest Signing**: Cryptographic signing of framework files during `npm publish`. Verified on `npx chati-dev init` install. Ed25519 keypair generation, SHA-256 per-file hashes, tamper detection with clear error messages
- **Read Protection Hook**: Claude Code PreToolUse hook that blocks reads of sensitive files (`.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, `credentials.*`, `secrets.*`, `.git/config`). Allows safe exceptions (`.env.example`, `signing-public-key.pem`). References Article IV
- **Per-Agent Persistent Memory**: PRISM engine now injects agent's `MEMORY.md` into context via `<agent-memory>` block. New `getTopMemories()` function sorts entries by confidence level (high > medium > low)
- **Semantic Linter** (`scripts/semantic-lint.js`): Cross-reference validation across entity registry, domain-agent alignment, workflow-agent references, i18n completeness, schema existence, and Constitution article count
- **Package Completeness Validator** (`scripts/validate-package.js`): Pre-publish validation of framework bundle — checks directory structure, root files, entity count, sensitive file exclusion, package exports, and bin entry
- **Signing Key Generator** (`scripts/generate-signing-key.js`): Ed25519 keypair generation utility for maintainers

### Changed

- `prepublishOnly` pipeline: `bundle-framework → validate-package → sign-manifest`
- QA-Implementation gate threshold raised from 90% to 95% (PASS) and 85% to 90% (CONCERNS)
- Hooks count updated from 5 to 6 (added read-protection)
- Constitution and governance context files updated to reflect 6 hooks and supply chain security
- Installer validator now checks Ed25519 manifest integrity on install

### Stats

- **944 tests** across 104 test suites (0 failures)
- **6 new files** + **5 modified files**

---

## [2.0.6] - 2026-02-15

### Changed

- Wizard simplified: auto-install MCPs (context7 + browser) and auto-configure Claude Code IDE
- Removed manual MCP selection step and IDE selection step from wizard
- Removed 4 redundant MCPs: exa, desktop-commander, sequential-thinking, github
- Cleaned AGENT_MCP_DEPS: removed phantom references (git, coderabbit, exa, github)
- Wizard now: Language → Project Type → Confirmation → Installation
- Removed `getMCPChoices()`, `getMCPWarnings()`, `stepIDEs()`, `stepMCPs()`
- Added `DEFAULT_MCPS` export for programmatic use
- Removed `select_mcps`/`select_ides` from all i18n files (en, pt, es, fr)

---

## [2.0.5] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Multi-Terminal Agent Spawning**: Orchestrator now spawns autonomous agents in separate `claude -p` terminals with correct model assignments (haiku/sonnet/opus per spec). Interactive agents (WU, Brief) remain in-conversation. Parallel groups supported (Detail + Architect + UX simultaneously)
- **Terminal Modules**: prompt-builder, handoff-parser, run-agent, run-parallel
- **Enhanced Spawner**: `--model` flag and stdin prompt piping for shell injection prevention

### Changed

- **CLARITY → PLANNING**: Renamed first pipeline phase across ~150 files. Folder `agents/clarity/` → `agents/planning/`, mode values, category labels, variables, object keys, Constitution wording — nomenclature only, no logic change
- Wizard simplified from 6 to 4 steps: auto-install MCPs, auto-configure Claude Code
- Tagline updated to "Structured vibe coding for Full Stack Development."
- README rewritten with new pipeline diagram showing terminal spawning, model assignments, and parallel execution
- CONTRIBUTING updated for Node >= 20, terminal module docs
- SECURITY updated with multi-terminal security section (write scope isolation, model enforcement, stdin piping, parallel validation)

### Stats

- **901 tests** (46 new for multi-terminal), 0 failures

---

## [2.0.4] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- **Parallelization as Default**: Added mandatory step 4.5 (PARALLELIZATION CHECK) to orchestrator transition logic
- Group 1: Detail + Architect + UX parallel after Brief (autonomous=default, HITL=option)
- Group 2: Dev tasks always parallel regardless of mode
- Renamed "Parallelization Hints" to "Parallelization Rules" in orchestrator
- Renamed "Parallelization Hints" to "Parallelization" in all 7 agents
- Brief handoff now sets `next_parallel_group` instead of single `current_agent`
- Dev agent gets new Parallelization section for task-level parallelism

---

## [2.0.3] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- **Brand Rename**: Project renamed to Chati.dev (capital C) across all files
- All GitHub URLs updated to match renamed repo (`ogabrielalonso/Chati.dev`)
- SVG logo text capitalized
- CI pipeline updated: skip npm publish when version already exists

---

## [2.0.2] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed

- **i18n Language Override**: Thin router now reads language from `.chati/session.yaml` BEFORE loading the orchestrator, overriding the IDE's global language setting. This makes the i18n language selection (EN/PT/ES/FR) actually work during active sessions

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- **Modular CLAUDE.md Pattern**: Framework rules auto-loaded from `.claude/rules/chati/` — zero `@` imports, zero approval dialogs, zero risk of accidental decline
- **Context Files**: 4 context files (`root.md`, `governance.md`, `protocols.md`, `quality.md`) in `.claude/rules/chati/` auto-discovered by Claude Code
- **CLAUDE.local.md**: Runtime state (session lock, current agent, recent decisions) moved to auto-gitignored file — never committed, never conflicts on upgrade
- **Migration v2.0.0→v2.0.1**: Automated migration to new modular pattern
- **Context validation**: Installer validator now checks all 4 context files (10 categories total, was 9)

### Changed

- Installer generates minimal CLAUDE.md (project info only) + copies context to `.claude/rules/chati/`
- Session lock now targets `CLAUDE.local.md` instead of `CLAUDE.md`
- Orchestrator updated to reference `CLAUDE.local.md` for all runtime state modifications
- Thin router (`.claude/commands/chati.md`) updated to pass `CLAUDE.local.md` as context
- Constitution article validation raised from >= 16 to >= 17
- Bundle script now includes `context/` directory
