and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.1.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Copilot double-prefix bug**: Fixed `claude-claude-sonnet` appearing in agent model upgrade conditions. Added negative lookbehind to prevent "sonnet if" pattern from matching inside "claude-sonnet if" produced by a prior replacement. Added 4 regression tests.

### Stats

- 1280 tests passing, 0 failures

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Framework Adapter**: New `framework-adapter.js` transforms Claude-specific framework files into provider-native versions at install time. Each LLM reads instructions written natively for it — zero runtime translation needed.
- **Pre-configured orchestrator per provider**: Orchestrator, 12 agent files, constitution, and context files are adapted with correct model names, file references, and CLI names during installation.
- **59 new framework-adapter tests**: Comprehensive coverage for all 3 non-Claude providers (gemini, codex, copilot), edge cases, replacement ordering, and real-world content patterns.

### Changed

- **Simplified entry points**: Removed runtime mapping tables from Codex SKILL.md, Gemini TOML, and Copilot agent.md. Replaced with "pre-configured for {Provider}" since orchestrator files are now pre-adapted.
- **ADAPTABLE_FILES**: 16 framework files adapted per provider (orchestrator, 12 agents, constitution, 2 context files).

### Fixed

- **Gemini creating GEMINI.local.md**: All CLAUDE.local.md references pre-replaced with .chati/session.yaml in Gemini orchestrator.
- **Codex showing "Model recommendation: haiku"**: Model names pre-replaced with codex/mini tiers in Codex orchestrator and agents.
- **"NEVER act as generic Claude" on all providers**: Pre-replaced with "NEVER act as generic AI assistant" for non-Claude providers.
- **Inconsistent UX across providers**: LLMs no longer waste cognitive load on mapping tables, leading to more consistent instruction-following.

### Stats

- 1276 tests passing, 0 failures

## [3.0.6] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Model name mapping for non-Claude providers**: All entry points (SKILL.md, TOML, agent.md) now include model name translation tables. Codex maps opus→codex, sonnet/haiku→mini. Gemini maps opus→pro, sonnet/haiku→flash. Copilot maps opus/sonnet→claude-sonnet, haiku→gpt-5. Prevents agents from recommending Claude-specific model names on other providers.

### Stats

- 1210 tests passing, 0 failures

## [3.0.5] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator auto-start for fresh installs**: When session.yaml exists (created by installer) but no agent has run yet, the orchestrator now skips the "Continue with X? (1/2/3)" prompt and immediately activates the first agent (greenfield-wu or brownfield-wu). This eliminates the confusing "resume" UX on first `/chati` invocation after install.

### Stats

- 1207 tests passing, 0 failures

## [3.0.4] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Installer feedback**: No longer shows "Created .claude/commands/" for non-Claude providers — shows provider-specific path
- **Provider Context Mapping**: All non-Claude entry points (SKILL.md, TOML, agent.md) include mapping table instructing CLI to replace CLAUDE.md/CLAUDE.local.md/.claude/ with provider equivalents
- **Codex creating CLAUDE.local.md**: Codex skill explicitly prohibits creating Claude-specific files
- **Gemini/Copilot context leaks**: Same provider mapping added to Gemini TOML and Copilot agent templates

### Stats

- 1208 tests passing, 0 failures

## [3.0.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Codex CLI Skill System**: Replaced non-functional `.codex/commands/chati.md` with proper `.agents/skills/chati/SKILL.md` (Codex native skill format)
- **Codex Quick Start**: Now shows `$chati` (skill invocation) instead of `/chati` (not supported by Codex)

### Changed

- `generateCodexRouter()` renamed to `generateCodexSkill()` — outputs SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- `codex-cli` configPath changed from `.codex/commands/` to `.agents/skills/chati/`
- Codex skill includes `description` field for implicit invocation (Codex auto-detects intent)

### Stats

- 1208 tests passing, 0 failures

## [3.0.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Multi-CLI Provider Isolation**: Selecting Codex/Gemini/Copilot no longer installs Claude Code files (.claude/, CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md)
- **Codex CLI as First-Class Citizen**: Added `codex-cli` IDE config, `.codex/commands/chati.md` thin router, proper /chati slash command support
- **Gemini CLI Standalone**: Gemini-only installs no longer create Claude-specific directories
- **GitHub Copilot Standalone**: Copilot-only installs no longer create Claude-specific files
- **Context File Generation**: GEMINI.md and AGENTS.md now generated from in-memory base content (no longer requires CLAUDE.md on disk)
- **Hardcoded Claude Code Fallback**: Quick Start no longer shows "Claude Code" when non-Claude provider is selected
- **Dynamic IDE Names**: Confirmation step and dashboard now show provider-specific IDE names

### Added

- `codex-cli` entry in IDE_CONFIGS with `.codex/commands/` config path
- `generateCodexRouter()` template for Codex CLI thin router
- Codex CLI handler in `configureIDE()` creating `.codex/commands/chati.md`
- Provider-specific model maps in config.yaml generation
