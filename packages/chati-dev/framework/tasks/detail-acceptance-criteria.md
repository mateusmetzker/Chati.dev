# Write Acceptance Criteria for All Requirements

## Purpose
Create comprehensive, testable Given-When-Then acceptance criteria for every functional requirement and edge case.

## Prerequisites
- `prd-draft.yaml` with FRs
- `edge-cases.yaml` with scenarios

## Steps

### 1. Load FRs and Edge Cases
Combine functional requirements with identified edge cases.

### 2. For Each Functional Requirement, Write Main Scenarios
Use Given-When-Then format:
- **Given**: Initial state/context
- **When**: User action or system event
- **Then**: Expected outcome

### 3. Add Happy Path Scenarios
Normal, expected user flow without errors.

### 4. Add Error Path Scenarios
From edge-cases.yaml, include failure scenarios.

### 5. Add Boundary Condition Scenarios
Test at min, max, below-min, above-max values.

### 6. Ensure Testability
Each criterion must be:
- Unambiguous (one clear interpretation)
- Testable (can verify pass/fail)
- Specific (not vague)
- Independent (not dependent on order)

### 7. Add Non-Functional Acceptance Criteria
Performance, security, usability criteria in testable format.

### 8. Link to UI Mockups
Reference screen names and elements.

### 9. Priority Tag Each Criterion
P0 (must-have), P1 (should-have), P2 (nice-to-have).

### 10. Generate Complete Acceptance Criteria Document
Comprehensive, ready for development and QA.

## Decision Points
None - systematic translation of requirements.

## Error Handling
- **Ambiguous FR**: Note ambiguity and provide best interpretation
