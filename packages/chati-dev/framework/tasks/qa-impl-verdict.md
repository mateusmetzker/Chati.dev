# QA Implementation Verdict

## Purpose
Issue the final QA verdict by synthesizing all QA implementation results (tests, SAST, regressions, performance), determining overall quality status, and deciding whether to proceed to deployment or return to development.

## Prerequisites
- test-results.yaml with final test execution results
- sast-report.yaml with security analysis
- regression-report.yaml with regression testing results
- performance-report.yaml with benchmark results
- quality-gates.yaml with pass/fail thresholds

## Steps

1. **Load All QA Implementation Reports**
   - Read test-results.yaml and extract status, pass rate, coverage
   - Read sast-report.yaml and extract vulnerability counts, severity levels
   - Read regression-report.yaml and extract regression count, severity
   - Read performance-report.yaml and extract performance status, degradation
   - Validate all reports are present and complete

2. **Evaluate Test Results Gate**
   - **Pass Criteria**: 100% test pass rate, coverage >= target (75% overall)
   - **Fail Criteria**: Any test failures, coverage < target
   - **Status**: PASS, FAIL, or CONDITIONAL (minor coverage gaps)
   - Document gate outcome with rationale

3. **Evaluate SAST Gate**
   - **Pass Criteria**: 0 critical vulnerabilities, < 3 high vulnerabilities
   - **Fail Criteria**: >= 1 critical OR >= 3 high vulnerabilities (exploitable)
   - **Status**: PASS, FAIL, or CONDITIONAL (high vulns with mitigations)
   - Document gate outcome with rationale

4. **Evaluate Regression Gate**
   - **Pass Criteria**: 0 true regressions, all changes intentional
   - **Fail Criteria**: >= 1 critical or high regression
   - **Status**: PASS, FAIL, or CONDITIONAL (medium regressions only)
   - Document gate outcome with rationale

5. **Evaluate Performance Gate**
   - **Pass Criteria**: All metrics within thresholds, < 10% degradation
   - **Fail Criteria**: Critical metrics outside thresholds, > 20% degradation
   - **Status**: PASS, FAIL, or CONDITIONAL (minor degradation with justification)
   - Document gate outcome with rationale

6. **Calculate Overall Quality Score**
   - **Test Results**: 25 points (pass rate, coverage)
   - **SAST**: 25 points (vulnerability severity, count)
   - **Regressions**: 25 points (regression count, severity)
   - **Performance**: 25 points (threshold compliance, degradation)
   - Total: 100 points maximum

7. **Apply Gate Logic**
   - **ALL gates PASS**: Overall verdict = PASS
   - **ANY gate FAIL**: Overall verdict = FAIL
   - **ALL gates PASS or CONDITIONAL, >= 1 CONDITIONAL**: Overall verdict = CONDITIONAL
   - Document gate combination and logic

8. **Determine Verdict**
   - **PASS**: All quality gates passed, ready for deployment
   - **FAIL**: One or more critical issues, must return to development
   - **CONDITIONAL**: Minor issues, can deploy with risk acceptance or quick fixes

9. **Compile Blocking Issues (if FAIL or CONDITIONAL)**
   - List all CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues
   - For each issue:
     - Source (test failure, SAST, regression, performance)
     - Severity and impact
     - Fix recommendation
     - Estimated effort
   - Prioritize issues by risk and user impact

10. **Define Acceptance Criteria for PASS**
    - If verdict is CONDITIONAL, define what must be done to achieve PASS:
      - Specific issues to fix
      - Acceptable risk mitigations
      - Documentation requirements
    - If verdict is FAIL, define complete remediation plan

11. **Generate Handoff Recommendations**
    - **PASS**: Handoff to devops agent for deployment
    - **FAIL**: Handoff to dev agent for remediation, list priority fixes
    - **CONDITIONAL**: Provide decision framework for stakeholder (deploy with risk vs fix)

12. **Log Verdict and Update Session**
    - Save qa-verdict.yaml with complete verdict
    - Update session.yaml with QA implementation status
    - If PASS (autonomous gate), trigger handoff to qa-impl-consolidate
    - If FAIL, flag for orchestrator to return to dev
    - If CONDITIONAL, prompt orchestrator for user decision

## Decision Points

- **CONDITIONAL Verdict Threshold**: If overall score is 90-95%, verdict is CONDITIONAL. Requires stakeholder decision: accept minor issues and deploy, or remediate first. Provide clear risk assessment.

- **Autonomous Transition**: If verdict is PASS and overall score >= 95%, autonomous gate allows automatic transition to qa-impl-consolidate and then devops. No manual approval needed.

- **Risk Acceptance for Deployment**: If verdict is CONDITIONAL due to minor performance degradation or low-severity SAST findings, assess whether issues are acceptable for production. Consider: user impact, workarounds, fix timeline.

## Error Handling

**Missing QA Report**
- If any of the four prerequisite reports are missing, cannot issue verdict
- Log error with specific missing file
- Status = INCOMPLETE
- Escalate to orchestrator for dependency resolution

**Conflicting Gate Results**
- If reports contain conflicting information (e.g., test-results says PASS but has failures listed), investigate
- Trust most conservative interpretation (if ambiguous, treat as FAIL)
- Log conflict and recommendation for report validation
- Flag for manual review

**Score Calculation Anomaly**
- If overall score exceeds 100 or is negative, recalculate
- Log calculation details for audit
- If recalculation fails, default to FAIL verdict
- Escalate for manual scoring review

**Autonomous Gate Trigger Failure**
- If autonomous gate should trigger but handoff fails, log error
- Do not proceed to next agent automatically
- Escalate to orchestrator for manual handoff
- Document failure in session.yaml
