# Consolidate Brief Document

## Purpose
Compile all requirements gathering work into a comprehensive brief document for user approval.

## Prerequisites
- `requirements-raw.yaml`
- `validation-report.yaml`
- `stakeholder-map.yaml`
- `constraints.yaml`

## Steps

### 1. Load All Artifacts
Read all prerequisite files and verify completeness.

### 2. Create Executive Summary
5-7 sentence overview covering:
- Project vision and goals
- Target users
- Key features
- Success criteria
- Timeline and budget

### 3. Consolidate Requirements
Merge and deduplicate requirements from all sources:
- Functional requirements with priorities
- Non-functional requirements with metrics
- All resolved constraints
- Success criteria

### 4. Define MVP Scope
Clearly separate:
- **MVP (Phase 1)**: Must-have features for launch
- **Phase 2**: Important but can wait
- **Future**: Nice-to-have, long-term vision

### 5. Document Personas
Include all validated personas with:
- Goals and pain points
- User journeys (high-level)
- Priority ranking

### 6. Include Stakeholder Map
Reference key stakeholders and decision makers.

### 7. Document Assumptions and Risks
- All assumptions made
- Key risks identified
- Mitigation strategies

### 8. Calculate Completeness Score
Verify all required elements present:
- Functional requirements (20%)
- Non-functional requirements (15%)
- Constraints (15%)
- Personas (15%)
- Success criteria (15%)
- MVP scope (20%)

### 9. Present to User for Approval
- Show executive summary
- Highlight MVP scope
- Point out key trade-offs made
- Ask for explicit approval

### 10. Generate Final Brief
Create polished, presentation-ready document.

## Decision Points
- **User Requests Changes**: Iterate on requirements before proceeding
- **Unclear Priorities**: Ask user to rank requirements

## Error Handling
- **Incomplete Data**: Request missing information before finalizing
- **User Unavailable for Approval**: Document and proceed with flag
