# Consolidate Final PRD

## Purpose
Merge all detailed analysis into a comprehensive, production-ready Product Requirements Document.

## Prerequisites
- `brief.yaml`
- `prd-draft.yaml`
- `nfr.yaml`
- `edge-cases.yaml`
- `acceptance-criteria.yaml`

## Steps

### 1. Load All Artifacts
Read and verify all prerequisite documents.

### 2. Create PRD Structure
Standard sections:
- Executive Summary
- Project Vision and Goals
- Functional Requirements (detailed)
- Non-Functional Requirements
- Data Models
- API Specifications
- UI Specifications
- Acceptance Criteria
- Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Assumptions and Dependencies
- Success Metrics
- Glossary

### 3. Merge Functional Requirements
Combine FR details from prd-draft.yaml with acceptance criteria from acceptance-criteria.yaml.

### 4. Consolidate NFRs
Include detailed NFRs with implementation approaches.

### 5. Document Complete Data Models
Include relationships, constraints, indexes.

### 6. Specify API Contracts
Complete endpoint specifications with request/response examples.

### 7. Include All Acceptance Criteria
Link each FR to its testable criteria.

### 8. Document Edge Cases
Comprehensive error handling documentation.

### 9. Add Visual Documentation
ASCII diagrams for:
- Data model ERD
- System architecture (high-level)
- User flow diagrams

### 10. Calculate Completeness Score
Verify all required sections present and detailed.

## Decision Points
None - consolidation is mechanical.

## Error Handling
- **Missing Sections**: Flag and request completion of prerequisite tasks
