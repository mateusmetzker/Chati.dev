# Map Stakeholders and Personas

## Purpose
Identify all stakeholders, assess their influence and interest, and create communication plan.

## Prerequisites
- `validation-report.yaml` with validated personas

## Steps

### 1. Identify Stakeholder Categories
- **Primary Users**: Direct users of the system
- **Business Stakeholders**: Product owner, executives, sponsors
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Development team, DevOps, security team
- **External Stakeholders**: Partners, vendors, regulators
- **Customers/Clients**: Paying customers if different from users

### 2. For Each Stakeholder, Document
- Name/role
- Interest level (high, medium, low)
- Influence level (high, medium, low)
- Needs and expectations
- Concerns and risks
- Communication preferences

### 3. Create Influence-Interest Matrix
- **High Influence, High Interest**: Manage closely (key stakeholders)
- **High Influence, Low Interest**: Keep satisfied
- **Low Influence, High Interest**: Keep informed
- **Low Influence, Low Interest**: Monitor

### 4. Map Personas to Stakeholders
- Link user personas to stakeholder categories
- Identify which personas are most critical
- Note any conflicting needs

### 5. Define Communication Plan
- For each stakeholder group:
  - Communication frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Communication channel (email, Slack, meetings)
  - Information needs (detailed progress, high-level status, demo)
  - Decision-making authority

### 6. Identify Decision Makers
- Who approves requirements?
- Who approves design decisions?
- Who approves budget/timeline changes?
- Who signs off on completion?

### 7. Document Potential Conflicts
- Conflicting needs between stakeholder groups
- Resource competition
- Priority disagreements

### 8. Create Stakeholder Engagement Strategy
- How to gather feedback from each group
- How to resolve conflicts
- Escalation path for blockers

### 9. Generate Stakeholder Map
- Visual representation of relationships
- Clear lines of authority
- Communication flows

### 10. Define Success for Each Stakeholder Group
- What does each group need to consider project successful?
- How to measure their satisfaction?

## Decision Points
- **Unclear Authority**: Ask user who has final decision-making power
- **Too Many Stakeholders**: Prioritize and focus on top 5-7

## Error Handling
- **Solo Developer**: Simplify stakeholder map, focus on end users
- **Large Organization**: Create simplified groups, avoid listing every individual
