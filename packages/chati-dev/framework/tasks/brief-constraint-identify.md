# Identify and Resolve Constraint Conflicts

## Purpose
Identify all project constraints, detect conflicts, and work with user to resolve them.

## Prerequisites
- `validation-report.yaml` with initial constraints
- `stakeholder-map.yaml` for authority on constraint resolution

## Steps

### 1. Consolidate All Constraints
From previous artifacts, gather:
- Technical constraints
- Timeline constraints
- Budget constraints
- Team constraints
- Regulatory/compliance constraints
- Business constraints

### 2. Analyze Each Constraint Type

**Technical Constraints**:
- Must-use technologies
- Integration requirements
- Platform requirements
- Data constraints
- Infrastructure limitations

**Timeline Constraints**:
- Hard deadlines (launch date, regulatory deadline)
- Soft deadlines (preferred dates)
- Milestones
- Dependencies on external events

**Budget Constraints**:
- Development budget (hours × rate)
- Infrastructure budget (hosting, services)
- Third-party service costs (APIs, SaaS)
- One-time vs. recurring costs

**Team Constraints**:
- Team size and composition
- Skill levels and gaps
- Availability (full-time, part-time, contract)
- Timezone distribution

**Regulatory Constraints**:
- GDPR, CCPA (data privacy)
- HIPAA (healthcare)
- PCI-DSS (payments)
- SOC2 (security)
- Industry-specific regulations

### 3. Detect Constraint Conflicts
Common conflicts:
- **Time vs. Scope**: Not enough time to build all features
- **Budget vs. Quality**: Budget doesn't support proper testing
- **Team Skills vs. Tech Stack**: Team doesn't know required technologies
- **Timeline vs. Quality**: Rush leads to technical debt
- **Multiple Hard Deadlines**: Can't meet all simultaneously

### 4. Assess Constraint Flexibility
For each constraint, determine:
- **Fixed**: Cannot change (legal deadline, existing API)
- **Negotiable**: Can discuss changes (MVP scope, timeline)
- **Flexible**: Can easily adjust (nice-to-have features)

### 5. Calculate Feasibility
Estimate if project is feasible given constraints:
- Required effort (hours) vs. available capacity (team × hours)
- Required timeline vs. estimated development time
- Required budget vs. estimated costs
- Required skills vs. available skills

If infeasible, flag with recommended adjustments.

### 6. Present Conflicts to User
For each conflict:
- Describe the conflict
- Explain the impact if not resolved
- Provide 2-3 resolution options with trade-offs
- Recommend preferred option

### 7. Collect User Decisions
- Which constraints are truly fixed?
- Which can be relaxed?
- How to resolve each conflict?
- What are acceptable trade-offs?

### 8. Update Constraint List
- Mark fixed vs. flexible
- Document resolutions
- Note any assumptions made

### 9. Re-assess Feasibility
- After resolutions, is project now feasible?
- If not, escalate to stakeholders for major decisions

### 10. Document Final Constraints
- Clear, unambiguous constraint list
- All conflicts resolved
- Feasibility confirmed

## Decision Points
- **Infeasible Project**: If project cannot be done within constraints, recommend scope reduction or constraint relaxation
- **Major Conflict**: If conflict requires stakeholder decision, facilitate that conversation

## Error Handling
- **Unrealistic Expectations**: Gently educate user on typical timelines/costs
- **Unwilling to Compromise**: Document the risk and proceed (user responsibility)
