# Risk Matrix Building

## Purpose
Build a comprehensive risk matrix mapping all features, components, and workflows to risk levels (critical, high, medium, low) with corresponding mitigation strategies and testing priorities.

## Prerequisites
- test-strategy.yaml with risk areas identified
- quality-gates.yaml with risk-based gate enforcement
- coverage-plan.yaml with module-level coverage targets
- Architecture and task documents showing all features

## Steps

1. **Enumerate All System Features**
   - Core workflows: greenfield pipeline, brownfield pipeline, mode transitions
   - Agent operations: task execution, handoffs, validation
   - State management: session.yaml CRUD, consistency checks, concurrency
   - File operations: create, read, write, delete, permissions
   - CLI commands: /chati, npx chati-dev *, help, status
   - Configuration: config.yaml loading, merging, validation
   - Internationalization: locale detection, translation loading, rendering
   - Upgrade system: version detection, migrations, backup/restore
   - Error handling: error construction, formatting, recovery
   - Mode governance: autonomous transitions, backward transitions, overrides

2. **Assess Impact for Each Feature**
   - **Critical Impact**: Data loss, corruption, or system unusable
   - **High Impact**: Major functionality broken, workaround difficult
   - **Medium Impact**: Minor functionality impaired, workaround available
   - **Low Impact**: Cosmetic issues, inconvenience only

3. **Assess Likelihood for Each Feature**
   - **High Likelihood**: Complex logic, external dependencies, frequent changes
   - **Medium Likelihood**: Moderate complexity, some dependencies, stable
   - **Low Likelihood**: Simple logic, no dependencies, well-tested patterns

4. **Calculate Risk Level (Impact × Likelihood)**
   - **Critical**: Critical Impact + High Likelihood OR High Impact + High Likelihood
   - **High**: Critical Impact + Medium Likelihood OR High Impact + Medium Likelihood
   - **Medium**: Any Medium Impact OR High Impact + Low Likelihood
   - **Low**: Low Impact (any likelihood)

5. **Map Features to Risk Categories**
   - Create a matrix with features in rows, impact/likelihood/risk in columns
   - Group features by system area (orchestrator, agents, state, file, CLI, etc.)
   - Highlight critical and high-risk items for priority testing

6. **Define Risk-Specific Testing Strategies**
   - **Critical Risk**: 90%+ coverage, integration tests, manual verification, security review
   - **High Risk**: 80%+ coverage, integration tests, regression suite
   - **Medium Risk**: 70%+ coverage, unit tests, spot checks
   - **Low Risk**: 60%+ coverage, unit tests, automated checks

7. **Identify Risk Mitigation Measures**
   - **Technical Mitigations**: Input validation, error handling, rollback mechanisms, backup strategies
   - **Process Mitigations**: Code review, pair programming, manual testing, staged rollouts
   - **Monitoring**: Health checks, error logging, user feedback, metrics

8. **Prioritize Testing Effort**
   - **Priority 1 (Critical Risk)**: Test first, most thorough, block release on failures
   - **Priority 2 (High Risk)**: Test early, comprehensive, block merge on failures
   - **Priority 3 (Medium Risk)**: Test standard, adequate, warn on failures
   - **Priority 4 (Low Risk)**: Test basic, minimal, informational on failures

9. **Map Risk to Quality Gates**
   - Cross-reference risk levels with quality-gates.yaml thresholds
   - Ensure critical/high risk areas have strictest gate enforcement
   - Validate that gate bypass procedures align with risk tolerance

10. **Document Known Risk Acceptances**
    - List risks that are accepted (not mitigated) with justification
    - Document residual risk after mitigation
    - Define monitoring/alerting for accepted risks

11. **Create Risk Evolution Plan**
    - Identify how risks change over project lifecycle (early phase: architecture risks, late phase: regression risks)
    - Plan for risk reassessment triggers (major refactor, new feature, security incident)
    - Schedule periodic risk reviews (monthly, per phase)

12. **Compile Risk Matrix Document**
    - Structure by system area with risk levels
    - Include mitigation strategies and testing priorities
    - Map to coverage targets and quality gates
    - Add risk acceptance records

## Decision Points

- **Risk Tolerance Calibration**: If stakeholders have different risk tolerances (e.g., startup vs enterprise), adjust impact/likelihood thresholds. Document the calibration in risk-matrix.yaml.

- **Testing Budget Trade-offs**: If timeline or resources are constrained, prioritize critical/high-risk testing. Document deferred medium/low-risk testing and residual risk acceptance.

- **Third-Party Risk**: For external dependencies (MCPs, npm packages), decide whether to include in risk matrix. Recommend: include integration points, exclude internal dependency logic (tested upstream).

## Error Handling

**Incomplete Feature List**
- If architecture or task documents don't cover all features, use best judgment from codebase exploration
- Flag incomplete areas for architect/pm review
- Assign medium risk by default to unknown features

**Ambiguous Impact Assessment**
- If impact is unclear, err on the side of higher risk classification
- Document assumption and flag for stakeholder input
- Provide range (e.g., "Medium to High impact depending on user workflow")

**Conflicting Risk Assessments**
- If coverage-plan.yaml and risk assessment disagree on priority, resolve based on risk matrix (risk-driven approach)
- Escalate to orchestrator if significant discrepancy
- Document resolution in risk-matrix.yaml
