# QA Implementation Consolidation

## Purpose
Compile the final QA implementation report synthesizing all testing, analysis, and verdict results, prepare artifacts for archival, and execute handoff to the appropriate next agent (devops on PASS, dev on FAIL).

## Prerequisites
- test-results.yaml (test execution)
- sast-report.yaml (security analysis)
- regression-report.yaml (regression testing)
- performance-report.yaml (benchmarking)
- qa-verdict.yaml (final verdict)

## Steps

1. **Load and Validate All QA Artifacts**
   - Read all five prerequisite YAML files
   - Validate schema compliance and completeness
   - Ensure verdict is consistent with gate results
   - Flag any inconsistencies for investigation

2. **Compile Executive Summary**
   - Extract verdict (PASS, FAIL, CONDITIONAL) and overall score
   - Summarize key metrics: pass rate, coverage, vulnerabilities, regressions, performance
   - Highlight strengths and concerns
   - Provide deployment recommendation

3. **Aggregate Test Results**
   - Total tests: unit + integration + e2e
   - Pass rate across all test types
   - Coverage by module and overall
   - List any test quality issues (flaky, skipped, long-running)

4. **Aggregate Security Findings**
   - Total SAST findings by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Accepted exceptions with justifications
   - Remediation status

5. **Aggregate Regression Results**
   - True regressions by severity
   - Intentional changes documented
   - Baseline update status
   - Smoke test results

6. **Aggregate Performance Results**
   - Key metrics: CLI startup, agent execution, file operations, memory
   - Comparison to baseline and thresholds
   - Performance improvements and degradations
   - Bottlenecks identified

7. **Compile Metrics and Trends**
   - QA implementation score breakdown by gate
   - Historical comparison (if previous releases available)
   - Velocity metrics: tests added, bugs found, time spent
   - Quality trend: improving, stable, degrading

8. **Document Remediation History (if FAIL verdict)**
   - List of issues found in initial QA run
   - Fixes applied by dev agent
   - Re-testing results
   - Number of QA cycles required to achieve verdict

9. **Prepare Artifacts for Archival**
   - Collect all QA YAML reports in .chati/qa-reports/[version]/
   - Save raw test outputs, SAST logs, benchmark results
   - Generate HTML reports for human review (coverage, SAST)
   - Timestamp all artifacts

10. **Update Baselines**
    - If verdict is PASS, update test baseline, performance baseline
    - Archive old baselines with version tags
    - Document baseline changes in CHANGELOG
    - Commit baselines to version control (if appropriate)

11. **Generate Handoff Package**
    - **For PASS verdict**: Create deployment checklist for devops
    - **For FAIL verdict**: Create remediation plan for dev
    - **For CONDITIONAL verdict**: Create decision framework for stakeholder
    - Include quick-reference guide to QA reports

12. **Execute Handoff**
    - Update session.yaml with QA implementation completion
    - Log handoff decision (to devops, dev, or orchestrator)
    - If autonomous gate (PASS verdict), trigger next agent automatically
    - If manual approval needed, prompt orchestrator

## Decision Points

- **Baseline Update Timing**: If verdict is PASS, update baselines immediately. If verdict is CONDITIONAL, defer baseline update until deployment decision is made. If verdict is FAIL, do not update baselines.

- **Archival Scope**: Decide whether to archive raw outputs (test logs, SAST JSON) or only summary reports. Recommend: Archive both for audit trail, compress raw outputs to save space.

- **Handoff Destination**: If verdict is PASS and autonomous gate is active, handoff to devops automatically. If verdict is FAIL, handoff to dev. If verdict is CONDITIONAL, handoff to orchestrator for user decision.

## Error Handling

**Missing QA Artifact**
- If any prerequisite YAML is missing, cannot consolidate
- Log error with specific missing file
- Status = INCOMPLETE
- Escalate to orchestrator for resolution

**Inconsistent Verdict**
- If qa-verdict.yaml says PASS but reports contain failures, investigate
- Trust individual gate reports over verdict
- Recalculate verdict based on gate results
- Log discrepancy and corrected verdict
- Escalate for manual review

**Archival Failure**
- If artifact archival fails (disk full, permission error), log error
- Proceed with consolidation and handoff
- Flag archival failure in report
- Recommend manual archival before deployment

**Autonomous Handoff Failure**
- If autonomous gate should trigger but handoff fails, log error
- Do not proceed automatically
- Escalate to orchestrator for manual handoff
- Document failure in session.yaml
