# Orchestrator Handoff Task

## Purpose
Receive output from a completed agent, validate it, create a handoff document, update session state, and route to the next agent.

## Prerequisites
- Agent has signaled completion
- Agent output available
- Session file at `.chati/session.yaml`
- Handoff directory at `.chati/artifacts/handoffs/`
- Agent definition with success criteria

## Steps

### 1. Receive Agent Output
Collect the completion signal from the agent:
- Agent name and completion timestamp
- Output artifacts (files, data structures)
- Decisions made during execution
- Quality self-assessment
- Open questions or blockers

### 2. Load Agent Definition
Read the agent's YAML definition to get:
- Success criteria (acceptance conditions)
- Expected outputs
- Quality thresholds
- Next agent in sequence

### 3. Validate Against Criteria
Check agent output against defined criteria:
- All required outputs present
- Quality score meets threshold (if applicable)
- Acceptance conditions satisfied
- No critical blockers

### 4. Build Handoff Document
Create structured handoff in markdown with YAML frontmatter:
- Metadata: agent, timestamp, status, quality_score
- Summary: What was accomplished
- Outputs: List of artifacts with paths
- Decisions: Key choices made
- Open Questions: Unresolved items
- Recommendations: Guidance for next agent

### 5. Save Handoff Artifact
Write handoff to file system:
- Path: `.chati/artifacts/handoffs/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{agent}.md`
- Ensure directory exists
- Validate write success
- Set appropriate permissions

### 6. Update Session State
Modify `.chati/session.yaml`:
- Set agent status to `completed`
- Add completion timestamp
- Increment pipeline progress
- Log decision made during this agent
- Update `last_activity` timestamp

### 7. Determine Next Agent
Based on pipeline position and mode:
- **DISCOVER → PLAN**: Follow sequence (wu → brief → detail → architect → ux → phases → tasks → qa-planning)
- **BUILD**: dev → qa-implementation
- **DEPLOY**: devops
- Handle special transitions (e.g., qa-planning → dev requires mode switch)

### 8. Check Quality Gates
Evaluate if mode transition should occur:
- **After QA-Planning**: If score >= 95%, eligible for planning → build
- **After Dev**: If complete, eligible for build → validate
- **After QA-Implementation**: If approved, eligible for validate → deploy

### 9. Prepare Next Agent Context
Package context for the next agent:
- Current handoff document
- Relevant previous handoffs
- Session state excerpt
- Project configuration

### 10. Dispatch Next Action
Execute the routing decision:
- If next agent in same mode: Route directly
- If mode transition needed: Trigger `orchestrator-mode-switch`
- If validation needed: Trigger `orchestrator-escalate`
- If end of pipeline: Mark project complete

## Decision Points

### When Validation Fails
If agent output doesn't meet criteria:
1. Assess severity (minor vs. critical)
2. For minor: Document in handoff, proceed with warning
3. For critical: Set agent to `needs_revalidation`, escalate to user

### When Quality Score is Below Threshold
If agent self-assessment is low:
1. Check if this is a QA agent (requires >= 95%)
2. For QA agents: Block mode transition, require rework
3. For other agents: Note in handoff, continue with caution

### When Next Agent is Ambiguous
If pipeline branching or user choice is needed:
1. Pause automatic routing
2. Escalate to user with options
3. Wait for explicit direction

### When Open Questions Exist
If agent has unresolved questions:
1. Categorize: blocking vs. non-blocking
2. For blocking: Escalate immediately
3. For non-blocking: Include in handoff, continue

## Error Handling

### Agent Output Missing
If expected artifacts are not present:
- Attempt to locate in alternate paths
- Check if agent logged failure
- Escalate with missing artifact list

### Handoff Write Failure
If handoff document can't be saved:
- Try alternate location (`.chati/backups/handoffs/`)
- Log to session decisions as fallback
- Escalate with write error details

### Session Update Failure
If `.chati/session.yaml` update fails:
- Retry with backup creation
- If persistent: Continue with in-memory state
- Warn user about state persistence issue

### Circular Routing Detected
If next agent would create a loop:
- Block the routing
- Escalate with loop details
- Request user intervention

### Mode Transition Blocked
If quality gate fails for mode transition:
- Document the failure reason
- Set agent to `needs_revalidation`
- Notify user of required rework
