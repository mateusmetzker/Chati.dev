# Break Project into Development Phases

## Purpose
Decompose the project into deliverable phases, with MVP as Phase 1.

## Prerequisites
- `prd.yaml`, `architecture-final.yaml`, `ux-final.yaml`

## Steps

### 1. Define Phase Strategy
MVP-first approach: Phase 1 = minimal viable features, subsequent phases add features.

### 2. Group Features by Phase
Phase 1 (MVP):
- User registration & login
- Create/edit/delete posts
- View posts
- Basic search

Phase 2:
- Comments
- Admin moderation
- User profiles

Phase 3 (future):
- Social features
- Advanced analytics
- Email notifications

### 3. For Each Phase, Define
- Objectives
- Features included
- Success criteria
- Estimated duration
- Dependencies on previous phases

### 4. Ensure Each Phase is Independently Deployable
Each phase should produce working software that can be demoed.
