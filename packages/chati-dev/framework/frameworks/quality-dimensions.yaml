# Quality Dimensions Framework
# Used by: QA agents for comprehensive quality assessment
# Reference: chati.dev/constitution.md Article II

dimensions:
  - name: completeness
    description: "All requirements are addressed in implementation"
    weight: 0.25
    measured_by: [qa-planning, qa-implementation]
    indicators:
      - "Every PRD requirement maps to a task"
      - "Every task has acceptance criteria"
      - "Every acceptance criterion has a corresponding test"

  - name: consistency
    description: "No contradictions across artifacts or code"
    weight: 0.20
    measured_by: [qa-planning]
    indicators:
      - "Brief problems match PRD requirements"
      - "Architecture decisions align with PRD scope"
      - "Code patterns match architecture document"

  - name: testability
    description: "Every requirement can be verified through automated tests"
    weight: 0.20
    measured_by: [qa-planning, tasks]
    indicators:
      - "Acceptance criteria are binary (pass/fail)"
      - "Given-When-Then format enables test automation"
      - "No subjective criteria ('looks good', 'works well')"

  - name: maintainability
    description: "Code follows patterns, is documented, and can be extended"
    weight: 0.15
    measured_by: [qa-implementation, dev]
    indicators:
      - "Consistent naming conventions"
      - "No code duplication"
      - "Design System tokens used (no hardcoded values)"
      - "Clear separation of concerns"

  - name: security
    description: "No vulnerabilities, proper authentication/authorization"
    weight: 0.20
    measured_by: [qa-implementation, architect]
    indicators:
      - "OWASP Top 10 addressed"
      - "Input validation at all boundaries"
      - "No hardcoded secrets"
      - "Proper auth/authz model"

scoring:
  method: weighted_average
  threshold: 0.80
  per_dimension_minimum: 0.60
  verdict:
    pass: "weighted_average >= 0.80 AND no dimension below 0.60"
    fail: "weighted_average < 0.80 OR any dimension below 0.60"
