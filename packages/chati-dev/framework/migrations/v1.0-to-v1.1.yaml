notes: |
  Migration rules:
  - Migrations run sequentially (never skip versions)
  - Every migration is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
  - Backup is created BEFORE any migration
  - Automatic rollback on failure
  - User artifacts (chati.dev/artifacts/, chati.dev/intelligence/) are NEVER modified
